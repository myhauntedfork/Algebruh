# **Algebruh**

_A collection of math tools, written in C++_

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **Algebruh**, the repository that's got your back with a whole toolbox of math! (I know; it's small at the moment. There's more coming!)

### **Features**

- Geometry (Area)
- Quadratic Equasions
- Stoichiometry

## **Getting Started**

Before diving into **Algebruh**, make sure you've got the following:

- Makefile (this one uses g++ compiler)
- Basic knowledge of math. But hey, no judgment if you just want to play around!

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/myhauntedfork/Algebruh.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd Algebruh`
3. compile and run the program (make sure you have makefile installed): `make` to compile `./build/algebruh` (add `.exe` extension if on windows)
